# AI Interaction Summary - Flutter Timer App Assignment

**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**User**: Nada Ben Slimen  
**Assignment**: Build a Timer App using Flutter with Figma designs

---

## Overview

During the development of this timer application, I leveraged AI tools to enhance productivity and
iterate faster on UI and logic implementation. The tools used include ChatGPT, Claude 4, and GitHub
Copilot.

## Tools Used

### 1. **ChatGPT (GPT-4o)**

- Assisted with:
    - Project setup and configuration.
    - Creating the `TimerProvider` for state management.
    - Structuring theme styles using `AppTextStyles`, `AppColors`, and applying them consistently
      across the app.
    - Troubleshooting Flutter errors and adapting architecture decisions.

### 2. **Claude 4**

- Used for:
    - Generating initial versions of the three screen UIs based on Figma links (Timer List, Create
      Timer, Task Details).
    - Providing layout structures and widget trees quickly.
- Note:
    - I used Claude primarily for quick prototyping of widget structures. The generated UI was
      heavily customized afterward to align with the design system.

### 3. **GitHub Copilot**

- Helped with:
    - Writing Flutter boilerplate code (e.g., `build()` methods, widget constructors).
    - Suggesting common Flutter widget patterns.
    - Assisting in form creation and dropdown setup for the Create Timer screen.

## Adaptations and Refinements

- **Switched from BLoC to Provider**:  
  Although the assignment prefers BLoC, I chose Provider for faster iteration and simplicity during
  the test. This choice is justified by my familiarity and the ability to manage in-memory state
  cleanly while meeting all requirements.

- **Style Customization**:  
  I replaced all AI-generated `TextStyle`, `Color`, and layout suggestions with reusable theme
  values defined in:
    - `app_colors.dart`
    - `app_text_styles.dart`

  This ensures design consistency and cleaner code.

- **Component Cleanup**:  
  I refactored code provided by Claude and Copilot to:
    - Remove unused variables or widgets.
    - Improve code readability and structure.
    - Apply correct padding/margin as per Figma specs.

## Sample Prompts and Results

### Prompt to Claude 4:

> "Based on this Figma screenshot, can you generate a Flutter widget for a list of timers?"

**Response**: Generated a basic `ListView` with `Card` widgets containing timer info and play/pause
icons.

**Adaptation**:

- Replaced default styling with custom styles from the design system.
- Restructured layout using `Row`, `Column`, and `Expanded` to better reflect the Figma structure.

## Final Thoughts

AI tools accelerated my development process, but all final code decisions, styling, structure, and
logic were manually reviewed, adapted, and tested. These tools served as assistantsâ€”not final
sources of truth.
